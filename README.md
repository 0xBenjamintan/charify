![Charify Landing Page](public/landingpage.png)

## Introduction to Charify üíØ

Welcome to Charify, an innovative Solana-based protocol that aims to reshape the world of charitable donations and empower voting power through recyclable funds. In this comprehensive README, we'll dive deep into the core concept of Charify, its mission, problem statement, innovative solutions, value propositions, roadmap, and how it intends to revolutionize the crypto space.

## Project Description üåü

### Problem Statement üóÇÔ∏è

#### 1. Accumulation of Scam NFTs and Tokens

The Solana ecosystem has seen an alarming proliferation of low-value and scam NFTs and tokens, eroding trust and tarnishing its reputation. These unwanted assets clutter wallets, leaving users vulnerable to potential losses, and hinder the overall growth and sustainability of the Solana network.

#### 2. Lack of a Robust Donation Protocol

The crypto community is enthusiastic about contributing to charitable causes. However, there is a noticeable gap ‚Äì the absence of a dedicated, reliable, and automated protocol for charitable donations directly on the blockchain. Current donation methods often rely on the efforts of influential figures in the crypto space, resulting in inconsistent and fragmented charitable acts.

#### 3. Inconsistent Charitable Acts

While there's a genuine desire within the crypto community to support charitable causes, the current methods of donation are often inconsistent. Charitable acts are typically driven by ad-hoc social media campaigns or influencer endorsements. This lack of an automated and systematic approach leads to sporadic inflows for charities, making it challenging for them to plan and execute their missions effectively.

### Solution ‚öôÔ∏è

#### 1. Burning Mechanism

Charify introduces a groundbreaking burning mechanism that empowers users to permanently destroy unwanted NFTs and tokens. This mechanism serves a dual purpose:

- **Security Enhancement**: By eliminating low-value and scam assets from circulation, Charify enhances the overall security and integrity of the Solana ecosystem. Users can protect their wallets from potential scams and security breaches.

- **Incentivized Participation**: To encourage user participation in the disposal of unwanted assets, Charify rewards users with 1 $CRY token for every token address burned. Additionally, 0.002 $SOL is sent to the CharifyDAO wallet, contributing to the project's sustainability.

#### 2. Governance

Charify empowers $CRY token holders with the right to vote for their desired charitable cause. This democratic governance approach ensures that the crypto community actively participates in deciding where the donated funds should go. The charity with the most votes receives the donation, ensuring transparency and fairness in the distribution of funds.

#### 3. Sustainable Revenue Model

To ensure the long-term sustainability of Charify, 5% of CharifyDAO wallet's funds are allocated to support further project development. This revenue model ensures that Charify can continue to innovate and make a lasting impact on the crypto community.

### Value Proposition üî•

Charify offers a range of compelling value propositions:

- **Enhanced Security**: The burning mechanism is not just a means to dispose of unwanted assets; it's a security-enhancing tool. By eliminating low-value and scam NFTs and tokens, Charify improves the overall quality of the Solana ecosystem.

- **Effortless Charitable Donations**: Charify streamlines the process of donating to charities on the blockchain. It makes charitable acts consistent and straightforward, ensuring that funds flow steadily to causes that need them most.

- **Community-Driven Governance**: $CRY token holders have a real say in the direction of charitable donations. This democratic approach empowers the crypto community to support causes that resonate with them, strengthening trust and transparency.

- **Incentivized Participation**: Charify rewards users for participating in the burning mechanism, creating a win-win situation where users enhance their security while contributing to the overall health of the ecosystem.

## Roadmap üöÄ

Charify's roadmap outlines its strategic approach to making the crypto space more charitable and secure:

- **Utilizing Sol Incinerator**: Charify plans to utilize Sol Incinerator for the burn mechanism, enhancing security and ensuring the legitimacy of burned tokens.

- **Building a Community**: Social channels will be set up to foster community engagement and encourage participation in charitable acts.

- **Implementing a Donation Epoch**: Charify will implement a 30-day Epoch for Donation Transactions, ensuring that donations are made regularly and consistently.

## Building Blocks üèóÔ∏è

To achieve its ambitious goals, Charify will need to develop several key components:

### Tech Stack ‚öôÔ∏è

Charify leverages the following technologies and tools:

- **Package Manager**: `yarn`
- **Smart Contract Development**: `foundry`, `solidity`
  - **Deploy**: `forge script`
  - **Typescript-Types**: `typechain`
  - **SDK**: `openzeppelin`, `ethers`
  - **Network**: `linea-goerli`, `taiko-gr√≠msv√∂tn`
- **Frontend**: `next`, `react`
  - **Contract Interactions**: `wagmi`, `rainbowkit`
  - **Styling**: `tailwindcss`
- **Backend**: `Kepler`
- **Misc**:
  - **Linting & Formatting**: `eslint`, `prettier`
  - **Design**: `excalidraw`

### Front End

- **Landing Page**: A visually appealing landing page will introduce the Charify Protocol, providing users with a clear understanding of its mission and functionalities.

- **Dashboard**: The dashboard will display users' NFTs on Solana, allowing them to select which NFTs to burn. This user-friendly interface ensures that the burning process is accessible to all.

- **Burning Page**: The burning page will implement a mechanism where 1 token burned results in the issuance of 1 $CRY token. This incentivizes users to engage in the burning process and participate in charitable activities.

### Backend / Smart Contracts

- **$CRY Token Development**: The $CRY token will be developed on Devnet, creating the backbone of the Charify ecosystem.

- **Burning Mechanism**: The burning mechanism will be implemented, possibly using Sol Incinerator, to ensure the secure disposal of unwanted tokens and NFTs.

- **Voting System**: A robust voting system will be created to allow $CRY token holders to participate in the governance of charitable donations.
